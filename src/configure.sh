# This NOT a GNU configure script!

# It configures the makefile for muforth based on which make you have,
# decides how to tell sed to use extended REs, figures out whether you're
# running Linux or OSX and configures modules accordingly, and on trees
# based on Git checkouts, sets up checkout and commit hooks to keep
# muforth's idea the "current" git commit actually current.

# If using git, configure post-commit and post-checkout scripts to generate
# a muforth file that defines the current git commit. If not using git,
# create a "fake" git-commit that pushes 0. We can check, in banner, which
# we have.

# Useful for scripts, so they know where they are

It appears that you are one of the few intrepid souls running NixOS.

We salute you!

If you want to use USB devices with muforth, you'll want to take the
udev.nix file that was just generated, which contains a service definition
and a few udev rules, and append it to your configuration.nix.

After doing a 'nixos-rebuild switch' or 'nixos-rebuild test' the new rules
should be available to udev.

A udev rules file has just been generated, which will be of interest to you
if you want to use USB devices with muforth.

Please do the following as root:

  # cp 99-muforth.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
  # udevadm control --reload

(or possibly some other command to tell udevd to reload its rules files;
'man udev' for the whole story).

If you are running this on a Chromebook, things are slightly more
complicated. /etc is on a read-only filesystem. The udev rules live in a
volatile filesystem (/run) and have to be re-copied every time you restart
your Chromebook, so you'll want to make a script. But the basic steps are:

In a non-chroot shell,

  $ sudo mkdir -p /run/udev/rules.d
  $ sudo cp ${muforth}/src/99-muforth-uid.rules /run/udev/rules.d
  $ sudo udevadm control --reload

Note that this way uses a different rules file; this one has a numeric UID
rather than a user name for each rule, since the Chromebook's /etc/passwd
and /etc/group files aren't going to have the user name info that lives in
your chroot.

Your USB devices are mounted on /proc/bus/usb and controlled by usbfs.
If you want to use USB devices with muforth you'll want to modify the
/etc/fstab line that mounts the usbfs to allow regular users to access
USB device files.
