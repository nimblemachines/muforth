/* "Multi-precision" integer arithmetic. */

/*
 * This file only exists because both C and GCC are incredibly lame. The
 * instructions exist on most processors for me to do what I want - namely,
 * multiply two 32 bit ints and get a 64 bit result, and also divide a 64
 * bit int by a 32 bit int, and get a 32 bit quotient and remainder. But I
 * can't seem to tell the C compiler that this is what I want. Among other
 * things, C stupidly lacks any notion of the carry bit, so doing
 * multi-precision arithmetic in the natural word size of the machine is
 * impossible.
 *
 * GCC claims to be able to do this kind of "double-length" integer math,
 * but when I've tried using "long long" the generated code was a joke, if
 * not completely wrong. It was making me crazy.
 *
 * Then I remembered reading about Python's implementation, which uses 16
 * bit "digits" on a 32-bit machine, and thought "aha!".
 *
 * We have to cheat, and totally waste the machine. But at least we get
 * what we want. We're going to define a new type - bigit - which is a "big
 * digit". We will carefully and intentionally choose its size to be 16
 * bits - exactly half what the "natural" int is on this machine, and since
 * the compiler -will- give us 32x32 multiply that yields a 32 bit result,
 * if we leave the high bits of each multiplicand zero, then a
 * "double-precision" (that is, twice 16 bits!) result will fit.
 *
 * From these bigits we will synthesise 64 bit math. The interesting thing
 * is that we're actually going to develop -arbitrary- precision
 * arithmetic, but then use it "only" for numbers with 2 or 4 bigits (32
 * bit and 64 bit quantities).
 *
 * Ready?

 *
 * Sometimes I really hate C and gcc. This is one of those times. It is
 * trivially easy to write the basic Forth word fm/mod in assembler. The
 * machine gives you the pieces you need: given two 32bit operands, it
 * multiplies and gives a 64bit result; then you divide that by another
 * 32bit operand. There is no opportunity for over- or underflow, and it's
 * about 6 instructions - including stack moves - in x86 assembler.
 *
 * It's impossible to do this in gcc. Grrr.
 *
 * Also, since integer divide by definition gives you both quotient and
 * remainder, why does C make you calculate them separately? It's stupid.
 *
 * So, I've given up on double-length math for muforth. It's a beautiful
 * and elegant part of Forth, but since I intend muforth mostly for
 * cross-compiling (to 32bit architectures at the moment, though that could
 * change!), single-length is plenty. So don't try using star-slash with
 * large operands. ;-)
