void mu_execute() { EXECUTE; }

/*
 * This is where all the magic happens. Any time we have the address of a
 * word to execute (an execution token, or XTK) - either because we looked
 * it up in the dictionary, or because we fetched it out of a variable - we
 * call execute_xtk. It is most commonly invoked by EXECUTE, which POPs an
 * xtk off the D stack, and calls execute_xtk.
 *
 * We need magic here because of the hybrid nature of the system. It is
 * *not* a truly indirect-threaded Forth, where you set up IP and go, and
 * never look back. We're executing C code, then Forth, then C... The Forth
 * inner interpreter never runs "free"; in fact, we run it in this routine!
 *
 * How do we know if the XTK refers to a Forth word or to a C routine? We
 * don't...until we run it. If it's Forth, the first thing it will do is
 * NEST - push the caller's IP - and then it will set IP to point to its
 * own code. In fact, that's *all* Forth words do when you execute them!
 *
 * So we save RP, then call the word. Then we loop *while* the current RP
 * is *strictly* less than the saved. If we didn't call a Forth word, this
 * will not be true, and we'll exit. But the word we called - the C routine
 * - will have run its course and done all its work.
 *
 * If it *was* a Forth word, it NESTED, and RP < rp_saved. So now we run
 * NEXT - a "constrained" threaded interpreter - until RP >= rp_saved, which
 * will happen precisely when the called (Forth) word executes UNNEST
 * (EXIT).
 *
 * That's all there is to it!
 *
 * Thanks to Michael Pruemm for the idea of comparing RP to rp_saved as a
 * way to see when we're "done".

 * I decided it can't hurt to support do/loop/+loop. Lots of people
 * understand it, and folks might have "legacy" code that they don't want
 * to rewrite into for/next.
 *
 * do/loop isn't a bad construct. I think really the only reason that Chuck
 * deprecated it - starting in cmForth - was that it didn't map neatly to
 * his chip! The runtime words (do) (loop) and (+loop) need two - or three!
 * - items on the stack. His original stack computer could only see the top
 * slot of the return stack. Hence, for/next, and simple count-down loops.
 *
 * We are going to implement a "zero-crossing" version. For some reason
 * many Forths choose to offset the start and limit values so that the loop
 * exits when the index "crosses" from the most negative number (8000...
 * hex) to the most positive (7fff... hex) - ie, when arithmetic overflow
 * occurs. I can't remember why this seemed like a good idea. I'm going to
 * implement a version that offsets the index so that the limit is always
 * 0. We'll see how that works.
