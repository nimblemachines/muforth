/*
 * A struct dict_name represents what Forth folks often call a "head" - a
 * name, its length, and a link to the previous head (in the same
 * vocabulary).
 *
 * Note that this definition does -not- include the code field. All of the
 * dictionary code - except for mu_find() and init_chain() - deals only
 * with these "pure" names.
 *
 * The way that names are stored is a bit odd, but has -huge- advantages.
 * Many Forths store the link, then a byte-count-prefixed name, then
 * padding, then the code field and the rest of the body of the word. This
 * works fine when mapping from names to code fields (or bodies) - which is
 * what one does 97% of the time.
 *
 * But the other 3% of the time you're holding a code field address, or the
 * address of the body of a word, and you wonder, "What word does this
 * belong to? What's its name?" (Doing decompilation is a great example of
 * this, but not the only one.) This kind of "reverse mapping" is
 * impossible with the above "naive" dictionary layout. The problem: it's
 * impossible to reliably skip -backwards- over the name. The length byte
 * is at the -beginning- of the name, but the code field follows it.
 *
 * There are a couple of hacks that have been used. One (adopted by
 * fig-Forth) is to set the high bit of both the length byte and the last
 * byte of the name. This way one can skip backwards over the name, but
 * it's a slow scanning process, rather than an arithmetic one (subtracting
 * the length from a pointer).
 *
 * Another (ugly) hack is to put the length at -both- ends of the name.
 * This obviously makes it easy to skip over the name, forwards or
 * backwards.
 *
 * A much nicer solution is to move the link field -after- the name, and
 * forgo the prefix length entirely. This is the solution that muforth
 * adopts (as dforth did before it). Instead of -following- the link field,
 * the name -precedes- it, starting with padding, then the characters of
 * the name, then its length (one byte), followed directly by the link.
 * (The padding puts the link on a cell boundary.)
 *
 * Experienced C programmers will immediately notice a problem: structs
 * (such as the one we want to use to define the structure of dictionary
 * entries) cannot begin with a variable-length field. (In standard C they
 * cannot even -end- with variable-length fields - or that's my
 * understanding. There are evil GCC-only workarounds, however.) So, what
 * do we do? We'd like to profitably use C's structs to help write readable
 * and bug-free code, but how?
 *
 * My solution is a bit weird, but it works rather well. Since I know that
 * the characters of the name will consume at least one cell (7 bytes and a
 * length byte), I define a struct that represents only the last 7
 * characters of the name, the length, and the link; the previous
 * characters are "off the map" as far as C is concerned, but there is an
 * easy way to address them. (To get to the beginning of a name, take the
 * address of the suffix, add the SUFFIX_LEN, and subtract the length.)
 *
 * Links still point to links; adjustments are made in a couple of places
 * to convert a pointer to a link into a pointer to a name entry (struct
 * dict_name).

/*
 * Structure of dictionary chains
 *
 * A dictionary chain is a linked list of words. The head of the list is
 * the most-recently-defined word; the tail is the oldest. A chain is
 * searched from head to tail, so if a word is redefined, the newer
 * definition is the one that is found.
 *
 * The muforth core defines three chains:
 *
 *   .forth.
 *   .runtime.
 *   .compiler.
 *
 * .forth. contains most normal Forth words. In particular, it contains
 * words that are safe to execute directly while interpreting.
 *
 * .runtime. contains words that can only be executed from within a colon
 * definition.
 *
 * .compiler. contains words that are only executed at *compile time* in
 * order to compile control structures and the like.
 *
 * The user can define their own chains.
 *
 * The body of a chain word - .forth. for instance - contains a pointer
 * to the last defined word on that chain. When executed, a chain word
 * pushes the address of this pointer, which can then be searched (using
 * find) or used to set the variable current, which causes all subsequent
 * definitions to be added to that chain.
 *
 * Chains are either *sealed* or *anchored*. In a sealed chain the tail
 * link pointer is NULL. Searching a sealed chain will only find words
 * defined in that chain. In an anchored chain, the tail link pointer
 * points into another chain - the one anchored *to* - and searches of
 * the first chain will continue into the second.
 *
 * There are two ways to do this anchoring: static and dynamic. In static
 * anchoring, when chain A is anchored to chain B, at the moment that A is
 * created the head link pointer from B becomes the (initial) head link
 * pointer of A. Because of this anchoring, searches in A will continue
 * into B, and words added to A appear to extend B's list. But if words are
 * added to B *after* A is anchored to B, these will not be seen when A is
 * searched. The connection point is static.
 *
 * In dynamic anchoring, when chain A is anchored to B, instead of
 * *copying* B's head link pointer and using it as a starting point for A,
 * A links *to* B's head link pointer directly. This means that head link
 * pointers need to be more than just pointers. They need to look like
 * names, since searches will follow links *through* them. But we don't
 * ever want them to be *found*, so we create a hidden name. Since there
 * are times when we want to know when we are crossing from one chain into
 * another, we use a *special* hidden name.
 *
 * As you might have guessed, muforth uses dynamic anchoring, and the
 * special hidden name used when defining chain words is "muchain".
 *
 * .forth. is a sealed chain. When interpreting, we search .forth. and
 * execute the words found there.
 *
 * .runtime. is anchored to .forth. . When compiling, we search .runtime.
 * (which also searches .forth.), and any word found is compiled.
 *
 * .compiler. is a sealed chain. It is searched only when compiling, and
 * any word found there is *executed* rather than compiled. .compiler.
 * contains what in traditional Forths were called IMMEDIATE words.
 */

/*
 * This is the word that defines the "behaviour" of dictionary chains, the
 * same way that mu_do_colon() defines the behaviour of colon words.
 *
 * The body of a dictionary chain consists of a hidden name ("muchain")
 * followed by a link field. This link field points to the
 * most-recently-defined word on the chain. (The variable current always
 * points to the link field of *some* dictionary chain.)
 *
 * When executed, a dictionary chain pushes the address of its embedded
 * link field. This can then be used for dictionary searches, or to set
 * current (so that later definitions are added to the chain).
