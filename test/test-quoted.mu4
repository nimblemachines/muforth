( This is wrong, on purpose. I was trying to figure out why in one version
  of this word I was adding two and in another, one. It turns out that that
  first version -had- zero termination characters, so I was skipping the
  count byte and the termination. Try running this code as is; then change
  the below word to "dup 1+" and see how much better it works!)
