# It looks a bit complicated. ;-) The idea is to automagically convert from a
# list of the C names of functions that implement muforth words to a list of
# their muforth names, formatted to initialize a C array. There are a few
# exceptional cases, but mostly it's pretty straightforward.
#
# sed rocks!

# lose lines *not* starting with "void mu_"
/^void mu_/!d

s/^void mu_//
s/(.*)\(void\);/\1/

# don't do do_colon, do_does - they are not real forth words
#/do_/d

# now we've got the name, save it in hold space
