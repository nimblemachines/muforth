# Create a udev rules file that matches all the USB devices we care about:
#
#   0403  - FTDI (Future Technology Devices International)
#   0483  - ST-LINK/V2 - for STMicro ARM boards
#   04d8  - Microchip (why? I forget ;-)
#   0d28  - MBED/CMSIS-DAP - for anything supported by mbed
#   15a2  - my Freescale HC08 JS16 board
#   1cbe  - TI/Luminary Stellaris/Tiva ICDI boards
#   c251  - Keil CMSIS-DAP - for Freescale Freedom (FRDM) boards
#
# I added the following fake vendor ID and plan to use it for future
# projects:
#
#   f0ff  - Suggests how I feel about the USB-IF's Vendor ID program
