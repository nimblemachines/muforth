-- This function only pays attention to lines that are wholly commented out
-- by a "|" at the beginning of the line.

-- Because I sometimes used square brackets [ ] in place of parens
-- (because otherwise the closing paren would end the comment), let's
-- rewrite square-bracket-enclosed text as paren-enclosed!

-- Since the opening and closing bracket may be on different
-- lines, we have to match them separately.

-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WARNING: This command is very fragile! I had to spend a lot of time
-- reading through the changes it made and adding lots of exceptions to the
-- matches (see below in l_rewrite() and r_rewrite()).

-- I don't recomment running this subcommand without looking CAREFULLY at
-- the resulting changes.
