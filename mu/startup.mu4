  Copyright 2002-2019 David Frech. (Read the LICENSE for details.)

( This file is muforth/startup.mu4. It contains high-level Forth code
  necessary to the useful execution of Forth. This file is loaded and
  interpreted when Forth starts up.

  The idea is to move as much code as possible -out- of the Forth kernel.
  Hence the name: "mu" is the Greek letter often used in engineering to
  represent "micro".

  This file exemplifies a Forth strength - shared by Lisp and Smalltalk,
  among other interpretive/compiled languages - that I like to call
  "writing the reader"; the reader being, in this case, the Forth
  interpreter/compiler.

  As defined in the kernel, the interpreter/compiler is very simple; it
  only knows how to do the following things:

  1. create a new colon word, making a dictionary entry for it;

  2. compile a "call" to an already-defined word [Forth lingo for
     "named piece of code"], by appending its execution address to the end
     of the colon word we are compiling.

  That's it!

  In this file, in Forth, we need to extend the interpreter/compiler to do
  the following:

  1. compile control structures: if/then, for/next, begin/while/repeat;

  2. compile data structures: variables, constants, create/does words;

  3. read and write numbers - an interesting exercise since muforth starts
     life not even knowing the constants 0 or 1;

  4. read and write strings.

  Once these are complete we will have a useful Forth for doing real work.

  The order of business will sometimes seem haphazard; words can only be
  defined after the words they depend on have been defined, so we end up
  jumping around a bit in the "semantics" of the language.

  Hopefully the reader will find this an interesting exercise in
  bootstrapping, which was precisely my intention.

  So, here goes; now we start extending the language, bit by bit.)

  hard first. Make changes below the line marked `Add changes below this

( First, we need compiler versions of ( and char. Since we no longer hide
  words as they are being defined, we need to be careful about how we do
  this. So let's define some words that are useful for searching specific
  dictionary chains and compiling words from them.)

( Roll tokenizing and searching into one.)

( jump allows jumping thru a table of addresses; you are responsible for
  making sure the index is within range! It must be used at the end of a
  word. Common usage looks like this:  jump  nope  do1  do2  do3  [

  That example assumes the top of stack has a number from 0 to 3.

  Since no UNNEST needs to be compiled, use of [ rather than ; to end the
  word is common.)

( make \ more like ANS-Forth's POSTPONE)
( Now, the confusion happens because we need to write code _in this word_
  that will compile the above code into _other_ words. How about that?)

( Read a token out of the input stream. If the token is on the compiler
  chain, postpone its execution until the word we're compiling executes. If
  the token is on the runtime or forth chains, postpone its compilation
  until the word that we're compiling executes. Got that? ;-)

( A nice way to do full-line comments with no trailing delimiter. It throws
  away the rest of the line, scanning for a newline, but only if there was
  a space after the -- . Without this test, -- followed directly by a
  newline will throw away the _following_ line, which is a bit mystifying.
  ;-)

( Defining words are next. Right now we only `know' how to make `colon'
  definitions. We need some structural help first.)

( I wanted to gain a little of the clarity that Chuck Moore's colorForth
  gains by getting rid of "[ <calculate something here> ] literal". He
  replaces the whole construct with colored words that are executed or
  compiled depending on their color, but with a little added twist: when
  switching from executed to compiled words -- yellow to green --
  colorForth assumes that the yellow words calculated a literal; just
  before starting to compile the first green word after the transition,
  colorForth compiles a literal.

  Even though we don't have color in muforth, we can make things a bit
  cleaner by assuming -- unlike traditional Forth -- that between  [  and
  ]  we will calculate a literal.

  How does it work? Simple.  ]  _always_ compiles a literal before
  restarting the colon compiler. To restart it _without_ compiling a
  literal, use  -]  .)


( Dictionary structure words. Link fields point to link fields. Roughly, a
  dictionary entry is the following cell-sized things: suffix, link, code;
  where suffix is the last 7 [64-bit] characters of the name, followed by
  its byte-sized length. Remember: high bit of length is hidden bit!)

: link>name    ( 'link - a u)
   1- dup c@ [ bl 2* 2* 1- #] and  ( 'len len)  tuck -  swap ;

( These words all assume we're calculating to or from a code field
  address.)

: >link   ( 'code - 'link)  cell- ;
: link>   ( 'link - 'code)  cell+ ;
: >name   ( 'code - a u)   >link  link>name ;
: >ip     ( 'code - 'ip)    cell+ ;

( create and does>. Everything old is new again. ;-)

( 2010-nov-30. After many iterations, I have finally arrived at fig-forth's
  implementation of create/does>. The only difference is the names of the
  words.)

( In fig, there are several kinds of words:
    * CODE words, whose code field points to machine code
    * COLON words, whose code field points to docolon, and whose bodies
      contain a list of execution tokens
    * CONSTANTS, whose code field points to doconst, and whose body
      contains a value
    * VARIABLES, whose code field points to dovar, and whose body contains
      a value
    * DOES words, whose code field points to dodoes, and whose body
      contains an IP pointer, followed optionally by data.

  In muforth there are only three kinds of words:
    * CODE words - primitives defined in C whose code field points to the C
      code implementation
    * COLON words, whose code field points to docolon; body contains a list
      of execution tokens
    * DOES words, whose code field points to dodoes; body starts with IP
      pointer - to parent's Forth code - followed optionally by data.

  fig and muforth share this inefficient but simple implementation. In the
  case of fig, it was because they didn't know any better. In my case, I
  knew better but in the interest of avoiding machine-code dependencies -
  the efficient way of compiling does> words essentially being a form of
  DTC [direct-threaded code] - I had no choice.

  If you want a threaded-code implementation using only pure pointers, you
  need two pointers in each "child" word defined with create/does: one to
  point to C [dodoes] and one to point to Forth [the body of the parent
  defining word].)


( last-created contains the ip address of the last <does> word defined)
here 0 ,
: last-created  [ #] ;  ( make the variable by hand!)

( does> fixes up the does ip of the last <does> word to point to the code
  after "does>" in the caller.)

: does>  pop  last-created @  ! ;


( The underlying engine for all "create/does>" words. It allocates no data
  space in the word. This version does not consume a token from the input
  stream, instead expecting one on the stack. This is particularly useful
  if we are meta-compiling another Forth and want to compile heads into the
  image, since we have to process the token - the name of the new word -
  twice.)

( Everything is defined in terms of `create'.)
: create
   new  <does>
   here last-created !  0 , ( placeholder for does ip)
   does> ;  ( make the does ip point *somewhere*)

: constant  ( value)
   create , ( compile the constant)  does> @ ;

   create , , ( compile the constants)  does> 2@ ;

( An array with every cell set to a default value.)
: defarray   ( default cells)  create  for dup , next  drop ;
: array      ( cells)  0 swap  defarray ;

( A byte array; length is rounded up to cell boundary.)
: buffer   ( bytes)  aligned  ( round up)  cell/  array ;

( A self-indexing array with every cell set to a default value.)
: defarray+  ( default cells)  defarray  does>  ( i - a)  swap cells + ;
: array+     ( cells)  0 swap  defarray+ ;

: variable    create  0 , ;
: 2variable   variable  0 , ;


( "nameless" colon words.)
: -:  here <:>        ] ;

( For comparison, the regular : compiler is defined thus:
:  :   new <:>  nope  ] ;
where nope is a placeholder for code to hide the newly created colon word.)


( We'd like to hide colon words as they are being created, and show them
  when they are complete.)

2variable last-colon  ( the link address of the last colon word defined,
                        and the chain it was defined in)

: show
   last-colon 2@  =if  swap !  0 0  then  last-colon 2! ;  ' show
   ( patch into ; )  .compiler. chain' ;  cell+              !

-: ( hide)
   current @  dup @  ( chain link)  2dup last-colon 2!  @ swap ! ( unlink) ;
   ( patch into : )     .forth. chain' :  cell+ cell+ cell+  !


( To bracket comments in a flexible way. If you've bracketed some text
  using comment, changing "comment" to "uncomment" will interpret the
  bracketed text - the delimiter becomes a noop.)

: comment
   token  ( the comment end token to match)
   begin  2dup token  =while  string= until  2drop ^ then
          2drop 2drop 2drop ;
: uncomment  new <:> \ ^ ;  ( create a noop word)


( How about a really cool word that makes self-parsing comment words? In
  other words, like using "comment" - defined above - but instead of having
  to say "comment **foobar** <commented text> **foobar**", you define
  **foobar** to skip tokens until it comes to a matching **foobar**!!)

comment no-self-comments
: make-comment  create  does> drop  untoken comment ;

( Here is one to get you started - good for block comments. It's 75
  characters long:)

make-comment

no-self-comments

( I guess we can have deferred words, even though they are, in some ways,
  inelegant. The alternative - creating a variable and a colon word that
  calls through that variable, for _every_ deferred word - is also in some
  ways inelegant - and clumsy.

  Actually, the way we define this is exactly equivalent to what we would
  have to do with variables; the difference is that instead of two named
  objects - the variable and the colon word that calls thru it - we have
  one - the deferred word - and we need an extra mechanism to get to its
  value to change it.

  The main argument _against_ deferred words is that they aren't orthogonal
  w.r.t. _user_ variables. The way we are defining them here they are
  implemented using a global, system variable. On muforth, we don't care,
  because we don't _have_ user variables; but on a properly multithreaded
  target machine things are different. There we probably wouldn't implement
  deferred words at all, using instead the "<variable> @execute" idiom; or,
  indeed, we could have all deferred use _user_ variables instead of
  globals. But that's what the fuss is.

  That and that "vectoring" them isn't strictly postfix. And it requires
  architecture-specific code!)

variable undeferred  ' nope undeferred !

( Defining new dictionary chains.)

( These used to be in an array but are now independent of each other. They
  are structures, created in the body of a does word, that look just like a
  name entry in the dictionary - a name-suffix followed by a link field.

  The name entry is always the string "muchain" followed by its length, 7.
  This is exactly 8 bytes long - the length of a suffix now that muforth is
  64-bit. The name identifies the word as the head of a dictionary chain.

  The name is hidden - by setting the high bit of the name's length - so
  that dictionary searches and word listings won't see it.

  The link field points to the link field within the name entry of the last
  word defined on the chain.)

: chain   create  [ token muchain  drop @ #] ,
                  [ bl 2* 2* ( 128)  2 2* 2* 1- ( 7) + #]  here 1- c!

: sealed           0  chain ;  ( create an independent vocab chain)

( It's also possible to chain to an -arbitrary- vocab by simply doing this:

  .arbitrary. chain .new-is-chained-to-arbitrary. )


( Conditional compilation.)

-- Schleisiek-style return stack words.
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

( Trying out, after all these years, the techniques that Klaus Schleisiek
  presented in 1984 [at FORML] and that I read about in 1993.

  The basic idea is that, in addition to return address pointers [saved
  IPs], there are stack frames on the return stack. These can be for any
  purpose, but we're interested here the following: local variable storage,
  "fluid" rebinding of variables - aka dynamic scoping, and
  cleanup-on-return - eg, to close a file that we opened.)

( Here is a picture of the return stack, with high memory towards the top of
  the page, and low memory further down:

  ^   |                    |
  |   +--------------------+
  |   |  prev return addr  |
  |   +--------------------+
  |   |        ...         |   several cells could be here; depends on the
  |   +--------------------+   type of frame
  |   |        ...         |
  |   +--------------------+
  |   |   cfa of cleanup   |
  |   +--------------------+
  +---+     prev frame     |<--- fp
      +--------------------+
      |    ip of remove    |<--- rp      remove calls unlink
      +--------------------+                                          )

runtime

variable fp    ( the "top" - most recently pushed - frame)
               ( fp points to a frame ptr, which pts to a frame ptr...)

( link creates a new frame. It fetches the cfa of the following word and
  pushes it onto the return stack. This is the cleanup routine. Then it
  links this frame into the list rooted at fp, and then returns to its
  caller, skipping the following cfa. link is called by a word that builds
  a new stack frame.)

: link     r>  @+ swap  >r    ( fetch & skip following cfa & push to r)
           fp @ >r  rp@ fp !  ( link this frame to previous)
           >r                 ( restore return address) ;

( unlink undoes what link did. It unlinks the frame from the list rooted at
  fp, and then runs the cleanup routine, which will do whatever is
  necessary to de-allocate the frame and undo any state changes made by the
  word that called link.)

: unlink   r>                 ( save return address)
           fp @ rp!  r> fp !  ( unlink frame)
           r> execute         ( execute cleanup word)
           >r                 ( restore return address) ;

create remove  ]  unlink ;    ( remove pushes IP when executed!)


( Now some interesting applications.)

-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Catch and throw
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

variable cf   ( catch frame pointer)

( These don't save or restore SP.)
: catch
   r>  @+  >r     ( fetch & skip following cfa)
        cf @  >r  ( push prev catch frame pointer)
   rp@  cf !      ( now point to this frame)
   execute
   r>  cf !       ( restore prev catch frame pointer)
   0 ;

( throw returns to word after catch. It is up to this code to unwind the
  stack!)

: throw  ( error)
   ?if
      cf @  cell+ @  >r  ( pretend to return from catch!)
   then ;

( unwind is useful in the context of exceptions. It starts at fp and
  unlinks each frame in turn until fp is zero or points to a frame above
  the current catch frame.)

( XXX Right now we are using unwinding as an on/off toggle, but in the
  future we could have different bits that could be tested by the various
  cleanup routines.)

variable unwinding
: unwind  ( unwind-flags)
   unwinding !
   r>  ( ra)
   ( While fp non-zero and pushed frames are below last catch frame, unlink them.)
   begin  fp @ dup  cf @  u<  and  while  unlink  repeat
   cf @  rp!
   r>  cf ! ( restore prev catch frame pointer)
   rdrop    ( discard return address from catch - we've already executed it!)
   >r  ( ra)
   unwinding off ;

( Punctuation in numbers: sign, radix, decimal point, separators.)

( NOTE WELL: This code - the number parsing code - has been a thorn in my
  side for ever. You'll see, as you read the following code and comments,
  that over the years I have made changes, but it has never been as simple as
  elegant as I would like. It needs a really good whacking.)

( 2006-mar-26. Ok, so this *totally* sucks. The presence of these bits of
  punctuation can mask a word not being found in the dictionary. A bare /,
  for instance, with no digits to keep it company, is happily parsed as a
  number. The number? 0. Urgh.)

: punct  ( a u ch - a' u' matched)
   over if ( still chars to process)  swap push  over c@  xor if
   ( no match)  pop 0 ^ then
   ( match)  pop 1 -1 v+  -1 ^  then
   ( end of input)  drop 0 ;

: ?sign  ( a u - a' u' neg)  char - punct  if  -1 ^  then  0 ;

( I wanted to add Michael Pruemm's '0' as a hex specifier, but it's not as
  simple as adding it to this list. It will match a bare 0, which won't be
  matched as a number.)

: ?radix  ( a u - a' u')
(   char 0 punct  if  hex ^  then )
   char " punct  if  hex ^  then
   char # punct  if  decimal ^  then
   char ' punct  if  octal ^  then
   char % punct  if  binary ^  then ;

( . resets dpl; others leave it unchanged; this means that embedding . in a
  number causes dpl to be set to the count of digits _after_ the _last_ .
  in the number.)

: dot?  ( a u - a' u' matched)
   char . punct  if  dpl off  -1 ^  then

   char / punct  if   -1 ^  then
   char : punct  if   -1 ^  then
   char _ punct  if   -1 ^  then  0 ;

( This is scary. We need a bunch of literals for `digit>'.)

: *digit  ( accum a digit - accum*base+digit a)
   rot  radix @ * +  swap  dpl @ 0< 1+  dpl +! ;

( 2002-mar-23. I still don't like how number parsing works. On the one
  hand, we know ahead of time exactly how many characters we have [in the
  token we are trying to convert]; on the other, the way the prefix [sign
  and radix] and embedded [. , - : /] characters work, we can't simply put
  them in a loop: there should be at most one sign and one radix at the
  beginning. Right now I have >number [which converts digits] and punct
  words _both_ checking if there are any characters left to process. This
  seems clumsy.

  And that "dpl!" in ?dot bugs me, too.)

( ANS compatible! - or at least it was when it converting with double numbers.)
( If >number finds a non-digit, it pops the return stack - which contains
  the for loop counter - and returns this value, which is number of
  characters left in the token.)

: >number  ( accum a u - accum' a' u')  ( a' is first unconvertible char)
   for  @digit?  0= if  drop pop ^  then  *digit  1+  next  0 ;

: digits   ( accum a u - accum' a' u' #converted)
   dup push ( chars left)  >number  pop over - ;

( XXX 2009-sep-01. The following doesn't make sense, and it's a lie as
  well, since 'number,' doesn't exist any more:

  Now some help for the colon compiler. Note that the colon compiler now
  calls `number,' to convert-and-compile and calls `number' when interpreting.
  This is so that `number,' or `number' can reset dpl when they're done. We do
  this so that constants don't screw up fixed-point arithmetic conversion.
  Without this code, if you were to use a fixed-point number, 3.1415 eg, dpl
  would be set to 4. Then `0' pushes 0 on the stack but doesn't affect dpl,
  so Forth tries to convert it, and BOOM.)

( Ok, folks, now that we have number parsing code we can redefine the
  interpreter and compiler, which up till this point have simply complained
  if they saw something not in the dictionary.)

( Let's define a word to create new modes. This is mostly useful for
  meta-compilers.)

: mode   create  ( prompt token-consumer)  ,  ,  does>  state ! ;


( To set the compiler consumer, we need a sneaky word to get the value of
  state while compiling - we use the same trick later to set the compiler
  prompt.)

( Redefine, and then set the forth "consume".)
-:   ( interpret one token)
      .forth. find  if  execute ^  then  number ;     state @  !

( Now set the compiler "consumer". To get access to the value of state at
  compile time, we turn on the compiler, but don't compile anything!)

    .runtime. find  if  ,       ^  then  number literal ;

( String primitives.)

( 2010-feb-27. In converting to a single dictionary space I was forced to
  "revert" to having strings compiled inline. Now we have to jump over
  their bodies again.

  The single string literal primitive is called (")

( It jumps over the inline, cell-count-prefixed string, and pushes the
  address of its first character and its length on the stack. Because all
  strings are compiled with zero-terminators, it is possible to pass the
  address of the first character to a C function, and it will work.

  I use z" to identify this kind of address. It suggests a zero-terminated
  string.)

( Copy string; return a counted string [addr of first character;
  prefix count cell _precedes_ first character of string].
  This does _not_ allot space in the dictionary!)

: scrabble  ( a u - z")
   here cell+ push ( z")
   dup here ! ( prefix cell-sized length)
   tuck ( u a u)  r@ swap cmove  ( copy string)

( all compiled strings have a zero terminator.)

( !!!!-------------------- Add changes below this line -------------------!!!!)

( Word listing. Putting this in as soon as possible. Needs `space'.)

( Cross-referencing with the Forth 2012 draft standard, forall-words is
  looking rather like the standard word TRAVERSE-WORDLIST, from the TOOLS
  extension, which has the following stack effect:

  ( i*x xt wid –– j*x )

( wid represents a wordlist. xt is an "execution token". TRAVERSE-WORDLIST
  executes xt with wid on the stack, and continues until the wordlist is
  exhausted, or until xt returns false.

  The invoked xt has the stack effect ( k*x nt –– l*x flag)

( nt is a "name token"; flag is true if traversal should continue, and
  false if it should terminate.

  During the execution of TRAVERSE-WORDLIST there is nothing on the stack -
  xt and wid have been popped - so that on each execution xt it is free to
  modify the stack, which is why its stack effect shows i items on the
  left, and j on the right.

  Let's translate this into muforth's terms, but let's change the return
  value from continue-if-true to exit-if-true. I prefer exit-if-true, and use
  it elsewhere in muforth.

  The word called for each word has the following stack effect:

    ( k*x 'link - l*x exit?)

( 'link is a link field address; ie, the address of a cell containing a
  link. Since in muforth's dictionary links point to links, simply
  executing  @  will follow the link.

  One gotcha with all this: I don't see a good way for forall-words to skip
  hidden words. It is left to the word that is called to process each word
  on the chain whether to skip hidden entries or muchains.

  In fact, .name-and-count-local *needs* to see hidden entries, since it
  stops processing when it hits a muchain, and muchains are by definition
  hidden. If the iterator skipped hidden entries it wouldn't know when to
  stop!)

( raw-load-file reads and interprets a file containing muforth code.

  Before reading anything, it resets the radix to decimal, resets the
  interpreter mode to the host forth interpreter, and sets the .forth. vocab
  chain as the destination for new definitions. It also redirects the console
  output to stderr, and sets up a few checking and cleanup routines to be
  executed on exit; most importantly, to close the file, and to check that
  the stack depth hasn't been altered.

  NOTE: We wait until we've both opened and read the file before resetting
  zloading and line, so we should get more accurate error locations!

  Because raw-load-file does *not* preserve the radix, mode, or current
  chain, any changes made to them by the loaded file will remain after the
  file is loaded. This is useful for loading a set of development tools that
  need to change into a metacompiler state, and perhaps switch to hex. See
  target/S08/build.mu4 for an example.)

  and interpret the file. Unlike raw-load-file, above, load-file preserves
  the radix, mode, and current chain.)

Display of the current radix is on by default. Use
   -radix   to turn it off,
   +radix   to turn it back on.

Display of the top several stack items is on by default. Use
   -stack   to turn it off,
   +stack   to turn it back on.

Digit separators (in number output) are on by default. Use
   -sep     to turn them off,
   +sep     to turn them back on.

Dictionary searches (via 'find') are case-sensitive by default.
   -case    makes them case-insensitive,
   +case    makes them case-sensitive again.

These defaults can be easily changed either by overriding them on the
command line, or by editing startup.mu4. Look for the word 'warm' near
the end of the file.
