| Copying stacks between host and target.
|
| This is just one part of the interact code that needs to be standardized.
| Ideally, every target would use *exactly* the same interact code (perhaps
| excepting its dumping and disasming code).
|
| But this is a move in the right direction. This is a (slightly) tricky
| piece of code, and there were several not-quite-identical versions
| floating around, none of which was very readable.
|
| This file defines three words:
|
|   depth    return the depth, in target cells, of the target's data stack
|   stack>   copy some or all of the host's stack to the target
|   stack<   copy some or all of the target's stack to the host
|
| stack> *first* builds a local image of the target stack - in the RAM
| image - and *then* copies it, in one chunk, to the target.
|
| stack< *first* copies the target stack, in one chunk, to the host's RAM
| image, and *then* pulls the values out and pushes them onto the host's
| stack.
|
| In both directions, copying is limited to a small number of items to
| prevent crashing the target or the host.
|
| I tried to make the code as simple and readable as possible, and because
| it uses \m words for anything related to target cells, it should work
| unmodified for all targets.
|
| Users of this code should define three values before loading this file:
|
|   stack-cell       | the size (in bytes) of a stack value
|   stack-sentinel   | the *value* to be used; or leave undefined
|   dp0              | address of bottom of data stack memory
|
| If you don't want a stack sentinel - read on to find out what this is and
| why it's (sometimes) necessary - just leave it undefined; no space will
| be allocated for it on the stack.
|
| Users must also define four words for reading and writing the target's
| stack. The first two are simply synonyms for the words for reading and
| writing the target's RAM:
|
|   stack-read   ( buf a u)
|   stack-write  ( buf a u)
|
| The other two are synonyms for fetching and storing a single stack item
| to or from the host's ram image of the target's stack:
|
|   stack@  ( addr - value)
|   stack!  ( value addr)
|
| In both cases, addr is a *host* address; it has already been "converted"
| by image+ .
|
| stack@ and stack! used to be synonyms for image-@ and image-! (with the
| caveat that the code below let them do the image+ mapping for each item,
| instead of doing it once at the beginning of the stack copy); however,
| I'm experimenting with an oddball idea: an 8-bit machine, with 16-bit
| "cells" (in particular, instruction memory is cell-aligned), but with
| a 24-bit stack! Hence the separate stack-cell, stack@, and stack! words.
|
| This code *should* be trivially simple, but there is a twist: some
| targets require a *stack sentinel*, and this sentinel must be ignored by
| depth, added to the stack image by stack>, and skipped by stack<.
|
| What is a stack sentinel, and why do some targets require one?
|
| A simple and common optimization for Forth systems is to cache the top of
| the data stack in a register, commonly called "t" or "top". This makes
| both unary and binary operations much more efficient. With top in
| a register, an increment, complement, or negate operation (for example)
| can change the value in the register without touching memory. For
| a binary operation - an add, for example - the second operand is popped,
| top and second are added, and the result is put into the top register.
|
| In contrast, without top in a register, a unary operation requires a pop
| and a push, and a binary operation requires two pops and two pushes. It's
| easy to see that this is going to be slower and require more code.
|
| For the host to execute a piece of code on a target that caches the top
| of the stack in a register, the following steps must occur:
|
|   - the host creates a memory image of its stack and copies it to the target
|   - the target pops the top of the in-memory stack into its "top" register
|   - the target executes the code
|   - the target pushes top back to the in-memory stack
|   - the host copies the memory image of the target stack back to itself,
|     and pushes the results on its own stack
|
| If the stack that is copied to the target is empty, when the target pops
| the top of the stack into its "top" register to begin code execution it
| will underflow the stack and read garbage. If instead the stack always
| has a sentinel as its bottom-most value, a target started with an "empty"
| stack (consisting only of a sentinel value) will begin code execution
| with the sentinel value in its "top" register, and the stack will not
| have underflowed.
|
| When the host calculates the depth of the target stack, and when it
| copies the stack image back to itself, it has to make sure to skip the
| sentinel; but when creating a stack image for the target, the host makes
| sure to push a "fresh" sentinel and copy it to the target. This way if
| the target ends up underflowing the stack or otherwise pushing
| a "garbage" value onto it, the next time that code gets executed - using
| the above multi-step process - that garbage value is replaced by
| a recognizable sentinel.
|
| It's not complicated, but it *is* a bit subtle, and it takes some
| thinking about to get a solid mental picture of what's going on.
|
| To make the following code easier to read - whether or not a sentinel
| value is involved - we use the following constants:
|
|   dp-sentinel      | data stack bottom, *including* sentinel, if any
|   dp-empty         | data stack bottom, *excluding* sentinel, if any
|
| If no sentinel value is defined for a target, the two values will be
| *equal*; if there *is* a sentinel, dp-empty will point one target cell
| *lower* in memory (the stack is growing *down*).

dp0 dup constant dp-sentinel  .ifdef stack-sentinel  stack-cell -  .then
        constant dp-empty

variable dp          | target data stack pointer; points to *top* of stack
