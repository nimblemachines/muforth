loading PIC18 Serial chat (core)

hex

| Taking inspiration from the wildly successful HC08 serial chat protocol.
|
| Responds to the following commands. NOTE: these are hex values!
|
| 00 - 0f  Idle   - these command bytes are ignored
|
| 10  get-version      - send 4 byte commit (little endian) to host
| 11  set-prog-addr    - set the program (flash) memory address pointer
| 12  set-data-addr    - set the data memory address pointer
| 13  get-data-addr    - get the current value of the data mem ptr
| 14  run              - load PC from flash-addr
| 15  read-prog-n      - read n bytes from program memory, incr pointer
| 16  read-data-n      - read n bytes from data memory, incr pointer
| 17  write-data       - write a byte to data memory, incr pointer
|
| These are Q-series commands for programming the flash, config, and
| eeprom.
|
| 18  set-nvm-addr     - set NVMADR from prog-addr
| 19  nvm-read         - execute an NVM read command, return data read
| 1a  nvm-write        - execute an NVM write command, return status
|
| 1b - ff  Idle   - these command bytes are ignored

| We are going to use FSR2 to point to data memory. Since this is also the
| stack pointer, our trampoline will have even less work to do when
| executing code!
