This directory contains the sources for a RISC-V Forth meta-compiler.

Like any meta-compiler it has several pieces:

  * a RISC-V assembler
  * a RISC-V disassembler
  * a compiler that consumes target assembler and Forth source code and
    generates a target memory image
  * some kind of "tethering" connection, either over a serial line or a debug
    interface (eg, JTAG), that allows interactive coding and exploration

Initially I'm targeting the HiFive1 board from SiFive, which features an FE310
chip containing an RV32IMAC core, and a debug interface based on the FTDI
FT2232-HL. Currently muforth talks to the core via SiFive's RISC-V-enabled
port of openocd. (In the future I want muforth to talk directly to the FTDI
chip, doing all the JTAG itself.)

As more cores, chips, and boards are released, I'll try to follow along with
support.
