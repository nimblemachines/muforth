| The following definition means that the .forth. chain won't get searched
| while chatting with the target. The idea is that this is *safer*. But it
| can also be inconvenient. While I've added a handful of .forth. words to
| .meta. to make this less painful, if not having access to .forth. is too
| much, just delete or comment out the following definition.
