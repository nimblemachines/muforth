( The following definition means that the .forth. chain won't get searched
  while chatting with the target. The idea is that this is *safer*. But it
  can also be inconvenient. While I've added a handful of .forth. words to
  .meta. to make this less painful, if not having access to .forth. is too
  much, just delete or comment out the following definition.)
