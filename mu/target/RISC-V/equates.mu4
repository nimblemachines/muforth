| .equates. contains chip equates and any other constants that should be
| visible to both the assembler and target compiler. When used interactively,
| or in the assembler, these push their value. When used in a target colon
| word, these compile literals.
|
| .csr. contains definitions only of the CSRs. They are in a separate chain
| so that it is possible for the disassembler to map from an address of a CSR
| to its name. If we put them in with the other equates we would never know
| if we found a CSR or something else with the same value.
|
| However, to make this less annoying for authors of token consumers, we
| chain .equates. to .csr. so that we can search *both* by searching
| .equates. However, when the disassembler looks for its match, it can start
| at the head of the .csr. and will only see those. So we get both ease and
| precision.
