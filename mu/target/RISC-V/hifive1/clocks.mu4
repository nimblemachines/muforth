( mtime is a 64-bit counter, clocked by the LFCLK - which, in the case of
  the HiFive1, is driven by a 32768 Hz external oscillator.

  mtime @  gives us the low 32 bits, which is all we need.)

: ticks  ( n)  mtime @  + begin  mtime @  over - 0< 0= until  drop ;

( If we run the chip for 32768 lfclk cycles - exactly one second - we can
  measure the speed by reading the mcycle counter. It will tell us how many
  cycles we executed in a second.)

: speed
   mcycle32@  32768 ticks  mcycle32@  swap - ;

: modify-trim  ( trim cfg - cfg')
   "001f_0000 bic        ( clear trim bits)
   swap 31 and 16 << or  ( or in new trim bits) ;

( Let's trim the HFROSC, fire it up, and then switch to it.)
: >hfrosc
   hfrosc-trim @  "4000_0000 ( enable, /1)  modify-trim  hfrosccfg !
   begin  hfrosccfg @  0< until  ( until ready bit)

( To test out trims other than the one stored in OTP.)
: retrim-hfrosc  ( trim)
   hfrosccfg @  modify-trim  hfrosccfg !  ( write new trim) ;

( Now let's fire up the PLL, and switch to it. Let's go for 320 MHz!)

   "1_0000 ( pllsel) pllcfg +bits  ( PLL drives hfclk) ;

( In case we want to return to a more "modest" state, we can go back to
  using the 16 MHz HFXOSC output as the HFCLK.)
