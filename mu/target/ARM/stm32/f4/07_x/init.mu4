loading STM32F407xG basic init

| Notes about the board.
|
| Unlike the F303 Discovery, the F407 has an external 8 Mhz crystal (8Mhz)
| attached; however, the 8Mhz signal from the MCO of the ST-LINK is *also*
| connected (to PH0/OSC_IN). This is unlike the (newer) F411E Discovery,
| which has the crystal connected, but *not* the MCO. 
|
| I have no idea why ST did this; what it means is that we should use the
| HSE bypass setting (as if no crystal was attached).

ld target/ARM/stm32/clock.mu4    ( clock utility words)

| Since we might be running this code from RAM, we need to assume that the
| clock might already be set up with the PLL running. Since we can't change
| any PLL settings while the PLL is running, we need to switch the system
| clock back to the HSE; turn off, reconfigure, and turn on the PLL; and
| then switch the system clock back to the PLL.
|
| NOTE: This example assumes that you are using an STM32F4 Discovery
| board with an F407 chip. On that platform, *both* the MCO and an external
| 8Hz crystal (X2) are attached to the F407.
|
| The F407 has *two* PLLs: main and I2S. We will configure the main PLL,
| but leave the second one unconfigured.
|
| There are two outputs on the main PLL: one for the system clock, and one
| for USB and SDIO. Here are the formulas (pll_in = 8M if we are using the
| HSE and the external crystal):
|
|   pll_out_sys      = pll_in / M * N / P
|   pll_out_usb_sdio = pll_in / M * N / Q
|
| The reference manual says that pll_in/M should be 2Mhz for the lowest
| jitter. So M = 4.
|
| VCO freq must be between 100M and 432M.
|
| If we want sysclk to be 48M,  N = 192, P = 384/48 = 8, Q = 384/48 = 8.
| If we want sysclk to be 168M, N = 168, P = 336/168 = 2, Q = 336/48 = 7.
|
| We want to turn on HSE, use it to drive the PLL to 48 or 168 Mhz, and when
| the PLL stabilizes, switch to it as the system clock source.

   -pll  ( turn off PLL)

| XXX FLASH_ACR also contains bits to enable the prefetch, instruction
| cache, and data cache. At the moment we are leaving them all at their
| reset values, which is probably a mistake.

| While AHB can run at full cpu speed (168M), APB2 has a max speed of 84M,
| and APB1, 42M.
|
| When running the cpu at 48M, we can't run APB1 at full speed; we run it
| @ 24M (/2) instead.
