( Even though the documentation gives conflicting messages - the schematic
  says that it's connected, but the user manual says that it isn't - it
  seems that the 8 MHz clock from the ST-LINK is *not* in fact routed to the
  OSC_IN pin on the F072.

  Instead, the F072 has a 48 MHz HSI - high speed internal - clock that can
  synchronize with the frame fields from USB, so it can be used as a
  crystal-less clock source, even for USB applications. We will use this as
  our system clock.)
