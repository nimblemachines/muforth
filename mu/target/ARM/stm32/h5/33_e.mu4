loading STM32H533xE chip

| The memory map on the H5 family is pretty complicated. There are two
| reasons for this:
|
| (1) Since this device supports ARM TrustZone, there are both secure and
| non-secure addresses for the memory and (many) peripherals;
|
| (2) There are two buses - Code and System - connected to the core, and
| the RAM can be accessed via both.
|
| Because of this, there are *four* origins for the RAM:
|
| 0a00_0000  code bus, non-secure
| 0e00_0000  code bus, secure
| 2000_0000  system bus, ARM ram region, non-secure
| 3000_0000  system bus, ARM ram region, secure
|
| To make things even *more* exciting, there are *three* (happily,
| contiguous) SRAMs, with different ECC and memory protection profiles:
|
|        offset    size    ECC?
| SRAM1  0_0000  128 KiB    no
| SRAM2  2_0000   80 KiB   yes
| SRAM3  3_4000   64 KiB    no
|
| The flash memory is similarly complicated. In addition to also having
| secure and non-secure origin addresses, there are several flash regions:
| user, system, OTP, OB_KEY.
|
| The user flash is divided into two 256 KiB banks; each bank consists of
| 32 sectors of 8 KiB.
|
|                    Non-secure              Secure
| User bank 1: 0800_0000 - 0803_ffff  0c00_0000 - 0c03_ffff
| User bank 2: 0804_0000 - 0807_ffff  0c04_0000 - 0c07_ffff
|
| The system flash consists of two 64 KiB banks, each consisting of 8 8 KiB
| sectors.
|
|                     Non-secure              Secure
| System bank 1: 0bf8_0000 - 0bf8_ffff  0ff8_0000 - 0ff8_ffff
| System bank 2: 0bf9_0000 - 0bf9_ffff  0ff9_0000 - 0ff9_ffff
|
| Rule of thumb for converting a non-secure address (these tend to be the
| ones that you are already familiar with) to a secure address:
|
| * in the Code region, add 0400_0000
| * in the System region (ie, RAM and peripherals), add 1000_0000
|
| To limit the complexity that we have to tame upfront, I'm going to ignore
| the secure addresses and assume that we can start out running the chip in
| non-secure mode. If, at some future date, it makes sense to explore the
| (rather complicated) security features, I'll add the other addresses
| then.

"0800_0000 constant @flash
    512 Ki constant #flash

"2000_0000 constant @ram         | the RAM, addressed via the system bus
"0a00_0000 constant @code-ram    | the RAM, addressed via the code bus

| Sizes of the constituent RAMs:
128 Ki constant #ram1
 80 Ki constant #ram2
 64 Ki constant #ram3

| To get from the RAM/SRAM1 origin (on the code or system bus) to the beginning
| of SRAM2 or SRAM3:

: >ram2         #ram1 + ;
: >ram3  >ram2  #ram2 + ;

#ram3 >ram3 constant #ram        | size of all the RAM, in aggregate

      16 Ki constant #bl-ram  ( ram consumed by bootloader)
