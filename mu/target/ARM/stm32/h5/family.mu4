| STM32H5 family settings

| Define chip family for downstream code.
-d stm32h5

| For loading chip-family-specific code; eg, the flash programming routines.
token, target/ARM/stm32/h5/  constant chip-family-path

| H5 has a uniform page size of 8 KiB, and two flash banks.

| Given a target flash address, return page index (plus shifted bank bit)
| and true if we should erase this address, and false otherwise. This is
| needed for target/common/flash.mu4

: erase?  ( 'target - index -1 | 0)
   @flash -  8 Ki /mod ( mod quot)
   swap 0= if  pages/bank /mod ( page# bank)  25 << +  -1 ^  then  drop 0  ;
