In this directory are two OpenSDA applications, which can be loaded onto a
Freescale "Freedom" board by booting it into BOOTLOADER mode (holding down the
reset switch while connecting its lower USB interface to a Windows machine) and
copying over the s19 file that you want to load.

CMSIS-DAP is a simple, ARM-originated debug protocol that embeds Coresight DAP
commands in 64 byte HID packets. It is supported by muforth.

The mbed firmware has its own USB mass-storage bootloader, and also contains
CMSIS-DAP capability. I know nothing about it, except that it tries to set the
"secure off" bit on the chip, at 0000_040c. Which is interesting... mbed claim
that they "worked with Freescale" to develop this code. Can they tell us
anything about it?
