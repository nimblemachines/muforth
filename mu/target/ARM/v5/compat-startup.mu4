( Because several things are different between the meta-compiler and the
  target's own compiler, it's difficult to test the loading of the ARM
  startup file.  However, it can be useful, so I'm going to try!

  This file creates a "compatibility layer" to make it possible to load in
  the startup file - at least to check if everything is defined.))
