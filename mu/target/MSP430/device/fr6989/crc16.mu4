( NOTE: From what I can glean from the - as usually terrible - TI
  documentation, using CRCDI shifts the data in LSB first, while using
  CRCDIRB shifts the data MSB first.

  In order to get the same results from the chip that I get from my C and
  Forth implementations [see src/crc16.c and mu/lib/crc16.mu4], I have to use
  CRCDIRB [data in, reverse byte] to input the data.

  Which register does the BSL code use?)
