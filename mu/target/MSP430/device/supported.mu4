  Right now there are only three choices:

     MSP430G2553
     MSP430F5529
     MSP430FR6989
)

.ifdef g2553
   ld target/MSP430/device/g2553.mu4

.else
   z" You must choose a device to compile for. Current options:
   -d g2553    to compile for the MSP430G2553
   -d f5529    to compile for the MSP430F5529
