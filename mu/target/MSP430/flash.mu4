loading MSP430 flash programming

hex

| The MSP430 has two areas of flash: main and info. Main memory is
| divided into 512 byte pages - which TI annoyingly calls "segments" -
| which are further divided into 64 byte rows - which TI annoyingly calls
| "blocks". Info memory is divided into 64-byte pages.
|
| A page is the unit of erasure. A row is a unit of exposure to "cumulative
| programming time". I think the way the flash code has been written that
| this isn't a problem, even doing word writes, rather than block/row writes.

| Fake "interact-level" code to do the flashing in a way that's compatible
| with the common flash code.
