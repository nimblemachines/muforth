loading MSP430 flash programming

hex

( The MSP430 has two areas of flash: main and info. Main memory is
  divided into 512 byte pages - which TI annoyingly calls "segments" -
  which are further divided into 64 byte rows - which TI annoyingly calls
  "blocks". Info memory is divided into 64-byte pages.

  A page is the unit of erasure. A row is a unit of exposure to "cumulative
  programming time". I think the way the flash code has been written that
  this isn't a problem, even doing word writes, rather than block/row writes.)

( XXX These are for main memory. Do we want to treat info memory separately?)
#512 constant /page   ( this is the erase size of main memory)
