loading MSP430 flash programming

hex

( The MSP430 has two areas of flash: main and info. Main memory is
  divided into 512 byte pages - which TI annoyingly calls "segments" -
  which are further divided into 64 byte rows - which TI annoyingly calls
  "blocks". Info memory is divided into 64-byte pages.

  A page is the unit of erasure. A row is a unit of exposure to "cumulative
  programming time". I think the way the flash code has been written that
  this isn't a problem, even doing word writes, rather than block/row writes.)

( XXX These are for main memory. Do we want to treat info memory separately?)
#512 constant /page   ( this is the erase size of main memory)
 #64 constant /row    ( max size of row to program)

: program-row  ( 'target len erase?)
   push  cr ." program-row "  over u.  dup u.
   r@  if  ." +erase "  then
   over image+ -rot  ( buf a u)  pop  t.FlashChunk
   0= if  error" flash access or protection error"  then ;

: erase?  ( 'target - f)   [ /page 1- #] and  0= ;

: row  ( 'target len - 'target+len)
   2dup + push  over erase?  program-row  pop ;

: flash-region  ( a len)
   /row /mod  ( r q)  swap push  for   /row row  next
                           pop  =if  ( rem) row  drop ^  then  2drop ;

( Check to see if we're going to clobber the bootloader and complain if
  we're not executing from RAM.)

order to re-flash it. Consult a local guru. ;-)" ;

      error" Your boot code runs into the vectors. Are you sure this is right?"

   then ;


: flash-buffer   pad  1 Ki  + ;    ( scratch space)

( Be careful about setting p. Some chunked read implementations use it, so
  set it *after* doing the read.)

( Do 256 bytes at a time. The chat protocol can only specify 255 words at a
  time.)
