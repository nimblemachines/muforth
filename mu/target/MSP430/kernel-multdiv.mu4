( Signed multiply of two 16-bit values.

  This is trickier. We have to be careful. There are several cases:

  * Both m-er and m-cand are 0<. Negate both, and proceed as with um*.
  * Both m-er and m-cand are >=0. Proceed as with um*.
  * m-er and m-cand have different signs. We want the m-er to be <0. If
    m-cand is <0, swap m-er and m-cand and proceed with "mixed" multiply:
    15 iterations of "unsigned" add and shift, followed by one "signed" add
    and shift. This is one instance when the MSP430's "natural borrow"
    causes us trouble. When we go to shift the product to the right that one
    last time, shifting in the carry on the left, because we did a subtract
    rather than an add, the carry is inverted. We fix this at the end by
    XORing top with 8000 hex.

  The following code is correct but is clumsy in several respects. One is
  that we had to implement the 0< tests awkwkardly because of a limitation of
  the instruction set: there is no "jump if not negative" instruction, only a
  "jump if negative", so we do 0< tests by jumping conditionally over a
  following unconditional jump. It works, but it's slower and longer than
  necessary. Sadly, there are several of these 0< tests in this code.

  The tests for the different cases could be structured differently.

  Swapping the m-cand and m-er is clumsy.

  And I'm not happy about the kludge with the last carry in. Will it ever
  be 0? Should I simply shift in a 1? We know the product is negative: the
  m-er and m-cand had different signs!

  One last note: This code pushes a "flag" value to indicate whether it
  took the "mixed" multiply route [-1] or the unsigned multiply route [0].
  Obviously, in the production code these flags will go away, but they helped
  track down a stupid bug: I was using "bit" [AND] rather than XOR to test
  whether the m-cand and m-er had the same sign. Go figure.

  Register use is like that of um*:

    w  is loop counter
    x  holds high half of result
    y  holds low half of result, and also 16-bit multipli-er - m-er
  top  holds multipli-cand - m-cand
)
code m*  ( n1 n2 - dprod)
   y pop ( m-er)  top x mov  y x xor  0< if  ( different signs)  -- -1 # push
      top tst  0< if  top w mov  y top mov  w y mov  ( exch)  then

      x clr ( prodhi)  #15 # w mov
      begin  1 # y bit  0!= if  top x add  then  x ror  y ror
             1 # w sub  0= until
      top x sub  x ror  y ror  y push  ( prodlo)  x top mov
      8000 # top xor ( complement last carry)  next
   then

   ( same sign)
   -- 0 # push
   top tst  0< if  top neg  y neg  then  ( now both >=0)  do-um* j  ;c



( Another quick take on this. We want m-cand >= 0. So, let's approach it
  this way: if m-cand < 0, negate *both* m-er and m-cand. Now there are two
  cases:

  * m-er *was* < 0 and is now >= 0. Jump to um*.
  * m-er *was* >= 0 and is now < 0. Great. Do the "mixed" multiply. And
    shift in a 1 at the end. ;-)

( Except that this fails. The problem is that we are assuming that if we
  negate a value that is < 0 we will always get a value that is >= 0. This
  fails because 2's complement has a singularity: the most negative number -
  8000 hex in a 16-bit world - negates to itself. It *stays* negative.

  So our assumptions in the cases above that m-er has switched signs are
  wrong, and lead to incorrect results. Eg,

    -7fff  8000 m*2 ==> 3fff_8000  -- correct
     8000 -7fff m*2 ==> c000_8000  -- WRONG: should be 3fff_8000
     8000  8000 m*2 ==> c000_0000  -- WRONG: should be 4000_0000

  We need to check same/different signs, as in the first m* above, to get
  the correct answer. Which is unfortunate, since the approach in m*2 is
  simpler and faster. And cleverer. And wrong. ;-)

code m*2  ( n1 n2 - dprod)
   y pop ( m-er)  top tst  0< if  top neg  y neg  then
   y tst  do-um* 0< until  ( both >= 0: do unsigned multiply)

   x clr ( prodhi)  #15 # w mov
   begin  1 # y bit  0!= if  top x add  then  x ror  y ror
          1 # w sub  0= until
   top x sub  setc  x ror  y ror
   y push  ( prodlo)  x top mov  ( prodhi)  next  ;c


( Take three? Let's combine the two and see if we can't get something
  reasonable.)

code m*3  ( n1 n2 - dprod)
   y pop ( m-er)  top x mov  y x xor  0< if  ( different signs)  -- -1 # push
      top tst  0< if  top w mov  y top mov  w y mov  ( exch)  then

      x clr ( prodhi)  #15 # w mov
      begin  1 # y bit  0!= if  top x add  then  x ror  y ror
             1 # w sub  0= until
      top x sub  setc  x ror  y ror
      y push  ( prodlo)  x top mov  ( prodhi)  next
   then

   ( same sign)
   -- 0 # push
   top tst  0< if  top neg  y neg  then  ( now both >=0 ... maybe ;-)
   do-um* j  ;c

( Take four? What if we just didn't care? m-cand m-er and both be signed.
  Let's see what happens.

    x  holds high half of result
    y  holds low half of result, and also 16-bit multipli-er - m-er

code m*4  ( n1 n2 - dprod)
   y pop ( m-er)  x clr ( prodhi)  #15 # w mov
   begin  1 # y bit  0!= if  top x add  then  x ror  y ror
          1 # w sub  0= until
   1 # y bit  0!= if  top x sub  then  x ror  y ror
   y push  ( prodlo)  x top mov  ( prodhi)
