loading S08 BDM support v2 (core)

( Support for Freescale's S08 Background Debug Mode - or BDM.)

( This is "version 2" which means I re-imagined it to be more like the
  byteloader protocol, where the target is never waiting for more than one
  byte.)

( I've split out the bit routines into two other files - one for the 908,
  and one for the S08. Look at bdm-bit-908.mu4 and bdm-bit-S08.mu4.)

( It turns out that because the 9S08QG8, when mostly blank, is hard to get
  into Active BDM mode. On POR - power on reset - it starts running random
  code and either gets a COP - watchdog - reset, or an illegal instruction,
  or illegal address. So it resets and starts all over again. Trying to get
  into Active BDM via the BKGD pin is basically impossible. There is a
  forum posting about this here:

  http://forums.freescale.com/freescale/board/message?message.uid=11435#U11435

  So, given that, we have to hold BKGD/MS low during POR in order to force
  the chip into Active BDM mode. A side-effect of this is that it selects
  the bus clock - rather than the "alternate" BDM clock - ICSLCLK - so the
  BDM will be running at 4MHz instead of 8. This makes life simpler in some
  ways, but it turns out that it's pretty easy to meet the timing specs for
  both 4M and 8M BDM with a "host" running at less than 6M.)

Included here for historio-comic relief.

How about the following commands:
0 Bye - escape back to byteloader
1 Write 1 byte from SCI -> buffer
2 ditto, 2 bytes
3 ditto, 3
4 ditto, 4
5 write to BDM, read nothing
6 ditto, read 1, write to SCI
7 ditto, read 2, write to SCI
8 send sync pulse, return two byte count
9+ Sync/No-op

Ten commands!

Read Status: 01 E4 05
Read A: 01 68 06
Read HX: 01 6C 07
WriteHX: 03 4C hi lo 05

We can always re-sync by writing 00 00 00 00.

Wanting to keep same "almost stateless" design as the byteloader. So, we
have the following commands:

Set write count
Set read count
Set byte (0..3)
Read byte (0..1)
Execute
Bye  ( escape back to byteloader)

So, for example, to execute the Read Status command, we do the following:
SetWriteCount(1)
SetReadCount(0)
SetByte0(0e4)
Execute

And to Read HX we do this:
SetWriteCount(1)
SetReadCount(2)
SetByte0(6c)
Execute
GetByte0 -> H
GetByte1 -> X

To Write a Byte (in background mode):
SetWriteCount(4)
SetReadCount(0)
SetByte0(0c0)
SetByte1(hi)
SetByte2(lo)
SetByte3(data)
Execute

Seems a bit inefficient, though - right?

How about a hybrid approach? We keep as much state as possible.. We'll
still need Set0..2 and Get0..1. But if the commands are mapped to the
actual BDM commands, and the "logic" is on the 908, that might be better.
The above examples would then look more like this:

ReadStatus
Get0

ReadHX
Get0 -> H
Get1 -> X

Set0(a_hi)
Set1(a_lo)
Set2(data)
WriteByte

That seems better... and common commands (running in Active mode) would
look like this:

ReadA
Get0

Set0
WriteA

All this is crazy - we just implement things the "normal" way - with the
exception that we number the commands from zero, for easier dispatching,
and we make command 0 be "Sync", which is a no-op. This is so we can easily
resync the protocol. By sending three 0 chars we fulfil any commands need
for bytes and if we exceed it, we loop at Sync.
