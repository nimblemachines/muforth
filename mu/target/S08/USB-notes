JS16 is recognised as composite USB device and matched by IOUSBCompositeDriver.
From the Apple docs:

If the device is a composite class device with no vendor-specific driver to
match against it, the AppleUSBComposite driver matches against it and
starts as its provider. The AppleUSBComposite driver then configures the
device by setting the configuration in the deviceâ€™s list of configuration
descriptors with the maximum power usage that can be satisfied by the port
to which the device is attached.

Composite class
    A device in which all class-specific information is embedded in its interfaces

bDeviceClass and bDeviceSubclass are both _zero_. This is what makes a composite device.

This is how they did it with the JS16. I should do the same. The composite
driver automatically instantiates the configuration with the highest power
matching the available power to device. This is work I don't have to do.
