loading PIC18 programmer over serial (core)

hex

( Support for programming PIC18 parts over ICSP, using a serial-connected
  S08QE or QG as a programmer. I need a 3v device for this! So I can't use
  my JS16 - until I set it up with an external 3/3.3v regulator!)

.ndef S08QG  .ndef S08QE32  .and  .if
  z" This code will only run properly on an S08QG or an S08QE32 part."  abort
.then

( The style of this code was inspired by chat3.mu4. It's really just an
  experiment to see if the style that I wrote the USB chat firmware in
  works in this context too. The main difference is that the original chat
  code was a big loop, where the USB "loop" was a subroutine - which meant
  that to return the "top" from any piece of code all you do is _return_.
  And using tail calls, it's easy to code in a Forth-like style that is
  very efficient.)

comment %% delay-times

  In HX is a _negated_ 16-bit delay count. We negate the count and
  count _up_ to make it easier to know when to increment the high half.
  Remember that inc and dec affect V, N, and Z, but not C.

  I _could_ put it on R stack. Delay would skip over ret address and decr
  2,s and 3,s.

  Delay time is 9n + (9n/256) + 18 ( pshes, ais, call+ret) cycles
              = 9n(1 + 1/256) + 18
              = 9n(257/256) + 18

  QE and QG parts have been trimmed to run at 9.216M so they can
  accuratedly generate 115200 bps clock.

  But one of my QE32 parts is running with a crystal at 24M.

  At 9.216M, to delay 5ms, n = (46,080 - 18) * 256 / (9*257) = 5098
  At 9.216M, to delay 1ms, n = (9216 - 18) * 256 / (9*257) = 1018
           to delay 100us, n = (922 - 18) * 256 / (9*257) = 100

  At 24M, to delay 5ms, n = (120,000 - 18) * 256 / (9*257) = 13,279
  At 24M, to delay 1ms, n = (24,000 - 18) * 256 / (9*257) = 2654
        to delay 100us, n = (2400 - 18) * 256 / (9*257) = 263.6

( A few delays to keep in mind:

  P5    40 ns  - between 4-bit cmd and 16-bit payload
  P5A   40 ns  - between last payload and new 4-bit cmd
  P9     1 ms  - after 4th cmd bit, hold PGC high to program flash
  P9A    5 ms  - after 4th cmd bit, hold PGC high to program config byte
  P10  100 us  - hold PGC low after pgm/erase before next cmd

  P12    2 us
  P15    2 us
  P16    0
  P18    0

  Since we are supposed to send a 4-bit NOP - %0000 - command, receive a
  byte from the host, and xor it with 55. If the result is zero, use this as
  the 4-bit command. If not, skip the programming step, but return the status
  ping.

  to accidentally program the PIC's flash.)
