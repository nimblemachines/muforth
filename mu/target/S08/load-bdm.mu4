( Load BDM code into S08's memory - either ram or flash - via its
  byteloader "chat" interface OR via BDM. Unlike the 908, which has only
  256 bytes of ram, the S08 has enough ram to try out the BDM code there
  before burning it to flash.

  Once this is done we can use this as a "bridge" to load and burn code
  into S08 chips - initially the same chat code, and eventually the BDM
  code as well.

  We adjust the "slot" number if we are loading the USB version of the
  code, which no longer fits into one slot - 512 bytes.)
