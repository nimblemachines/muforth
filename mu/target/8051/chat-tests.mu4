( First, we want to testing that programming the flash works. Let's just
| define a couple of silly words, which we can use to test code execution.)

flash  200 region!  ( skip chat code!)

label reg-test
   ff # r0 mov   f0 # r1 mov   ef # r2 mov   e0 # r3 mov   ret  ;c

( Also, we want to put some values into the ram and xram images to test
| that they get copied over to the target ram and xram spaces.)

ram  80 goto  ( a safe place)
   cafe ,  feed ,  beef ,

xram
   babe ,  d00d ,  fade ,
