loading AVR heartbeat (software PWM)

__meta
hex

( Output to modulate - probably connected to an LED.)
0 PORTB ( bit port) 2constant heart-led

| We want the heartbeat to be a triangle wave. The simplest way to achieve
| this, with the fewest glitches and corner cases, is to XOR a sawtooth
| wave at frequency f with a polarity square wave at f/2.

| 00 01 02 ... fc fd fe ff 00 01 02 ... fc fd fe ff     Sawtooth
| 00 00 00 ... 00 00 00 00 ff ff ff ... ff ff ff ff     Polarity
| 00 01 02 ... fc fd fe ff ff fe fd ... 03 02 01 00     Output

( These two values are modified by timer overflow interrupt.)
1 var heart-index     ( how far we are into our 256-point pwm cycle)
                      ( heart task's status byte)

| sawtooth, polarity, and heart-output are modified by the heartbeat task,
| which is woken up every time the interrupt's increment of heart-index
| overflows.

\a xl constant sawtooth  ( xl reg = current sawtooth pwm value)
\a xh constant polarity  ( xh reg = current polarity value - 00 or ff)

1 var heart-output    ( current output pwm = sawtooth xor polarity)

( At 8M clock, timer overflows at 31.25k, or every 32us.)
