loading AVR simple chat over IIC (core)

__meta

hex

( See target/AVR/chat-iic-core.mu4 for the complete, improved version of
  this code.)

( NOTE!! Atmel calls the IIC interface "TWI" - two-wire interface. While
  I'm calling it IIC everywhere else, in this file it makes no sense to do
  anything except use Atmel's conventions, esp since several registers and
  constants have "TWI" baked into their names.)

Commands for a simple client debug stub for talking to an AVR chip over IIC.

         sends            returns
  =================================
  SetAddr  <lo>  <hi>     nothing
  ReadProgram             <byte>
  ReadData                <byte>
  WriteData  <byte>       nothing
  Go                      nothing

  ReadData, WriteData read and write data memory -- including the general
        registers, stack pointer, all the i/o registers, and all the RAM.

  ReadProgram reads program memory (flash)

  SetAddr sets the address to be used for reading & writing memory

  Go execute code from the address set by SetAddr

6 equ TWEA   ( bit#)  ( enable receipt of slave address)

Status codes for slave receive mode:

  68  as above, but lost arbitration first
  70  general call addr received and ACKed
  78  as above, but lost arbitration first
  80  prev addressed with own address; data byte recvd and ACKed
  88  as above, NACKed
  90  prev addressed with general call; data byte recvd and ACKed
  98  as above, NACKed
  a0  STOP or repeated START received while in slave receive mode

  Status codes for slave transmit mode:

  a8  own addr+read received and ACKed
  b8  data byte xmitted and ACKed
  c0  as above, but NACKed
  c8  last byte xmitted (TWEA=0), ACKed

  r16 -- 10 hex -- is used for checking and passing around TWI status
  r17 -- 11 hex -- is used solely for acknowledging TWINT bit
  r24 -- 18 hex -- is used for data bytes
  r30/31 -- aka z -- is used to point to memory

( This is a bit tricky! Since the host had to send a new transaction for
  the read, on the first byte we're going to see _two_ interrupts: first,
  that while addressed as a slave receiver we got a STOP or RESTART; and
  second, that we were addressed as slave+read. We have to watch for, and
  ack, both.

  If we wanted to send multiple bytes back to the master, this would be
  even more complicated, since only the _first_ byte sent would look for
  and match status a0, and the later bytes would be acked with a b8 instead
  of a8.)

label write-data
   read-byte rcall  18 st z+  ret  ;c

( Don't tail-call convert read-data and write-data! We need to actually _nest_
  our calls to read-byte and write-byte so there is an address on the R stack
  for them to pop in case of error!)

label read-data
   18 ld z+    write-byte rcall  ret  ;c

label read-program
   18 ld pmz+  write-byte rcall  ret  ;c


( XXX Note that this won't work as written! Due to brain damage on the part
  the AVR's designers, ijmp and icall treat the contents of the Z register
  pair _differently_ than do the memory read and write operations! For ijmp
  and icall, Z contains a _word_ address, and allows transferring control to
  128 Ki of program space, where ldm and spm only allow access to 64 Ki of
  space. Go figure.

  Unless we either shift right Z here, or the host computer does it before
  writing to Z, there is no hope that this code will work.)

( Clear TWEA so we NACK our address while executing code. Do this without
  resetting TWINT again.)
