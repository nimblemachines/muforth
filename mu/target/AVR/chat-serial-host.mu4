loading AVR serial chat (host)

hex

| Taking inspiration from the wildly successful HC08 serial chat protocol.

| Responds to the following commands. NOTE: these are hex values!
|
| 00 - 0f  idle        - these command bytes are ignored
| 1c - ff  idle        - these command bytes are ignored
|
| 10  version-addr     - get the address of the version commit
| 11  set-addr         - set memory address
| 12  get-addr         - get memory address
| 13  run              - push mem addr as ra; set mem addr; execute
|
| 14  read-flash       - set count, then streaming read of flash
| 15  read-data        - read one byte of ram/data space, incr Z
| 16  read-eeprom      - read one byte of xram, incr Z
|
| 17  write-flash      - write a word to flash page buffer, incr Z by 2
| 18  write-data       - write one byte to ram/data space, incr Z
| 19  write-eeprom     - write one byte to eeprom, incr Z
|
| 1a  app-start
| 1b  app-stop

| NOTE: To execute code on the target, we pass two values to chat: a PC in
| return address (ra) form, and data stack pointer (DP). Generally, the PC
| will point to a trampoline that will marshal and unmarshal argument
| values, one of which will be a pointer to *another* piece of code to
| execute. After *that* code executes, it returns to the trampoline, which
| (possibly) pushes values onto the data stack, and then returns to chat.
|
| It sounds complicated, but moving the trampoline *out* of chat and into
| the user's code makes the chat code simpler and shorter, and
| - importantly - makes the process of executing target code much more
| flexible, since the calling conventions, stack pointer choices, etc, are
| no longer baked into the chat code. Instead, each type of code can have
| a trampoline perfectly suited to it.
|
| As a concrete example, when calling threaded Forth code, the data stack
| pointer (DP) is usually the *machine* stack pointer (MP), and the return
| stack pointer (RP) is a generic pointer register.
|
| When calling assembler or non-threaded Forth code, these are reversed!
|
| Having separate trampolines for each keeps these details out of the chat
| code.

: c.run  ( pc dp)
   swap \m >ra cx.set-addr  ( set mem addr to PC in ra form)
   cx.run  ( set mem addr to DP and execute code) ;

| Get the current value of the mem address pointer; this is our data stack
| pointer (DP).

: c.get-status  ( - dp)  cx.get-addr ;

( Interact code handles which memory space we are reading.)

   c.setup-chunk  for  m* cx.write-data  next ;

: c.write-eeprom   ( buf a u)
   c.setup-chunk  for  m* cx.write-eeprom  next ;

| For app-stop we send the app-stop command, then the get-status command -
| to make sure it's done executing - and throw away the value.

: c.app-stop
   cx.app-stop  c.get-status drop ;

( Before flashing, make sure to stop the app.)
: c.flash-begin   c.app-stop ;

| After flashing, we have to re-enable the RWW section. But we don't
| automatically start the app running again. We want to verify first, at
| the very least!

: c.erase     ( a)
   cx.set-addr  0 %0000_0011 ( PGERS + SELFPRGEN) cx.write-flash  ( erase page) ;

| For each word in buf, write it to the chip's flash page buffer, then send
| the page program command.

| NOTE: We are *provisionally* removing app-start and app-stop from the
| chat-via array, and *deprecating* their use in interact.mu4.
