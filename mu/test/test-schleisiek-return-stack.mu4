( Trying out, after all these years, the techniques that Klaus Schleisiek
| presented in 1984 [at FORML] and that I read about in 1993.
|
| The basic idea is that, in addition to return address pointers
| [saved IPs], there are stack frames on the return stack. These can be for
| any purpose, but we're interested here the following: trap frames, local
| variable storage, and "fluid" rebinding of variables - aka dynamic
| scoping.)

( Here is a picture of the return stack, with high memory towards the top of
| the page, and low memory further down:
|
| ^   |                    |
| |   +--------------------+
| |   |  prev return addr  |
| |   +--------------------+
| |   |        ...         |   several cells could be here; depends on the
| |   +--------------------+   type of frame
| |   |        ...         |
| |   +--------------------+
| |   |   cfa of cleanup   |
| |   +--------------------+
| +---+     prev frame     |<--- fp
|     +--------------------+
|     |    ip of remove    |<--- rp      remove just calls unlink
|     +--------------------+                                          )

variable fp    ( the "top" - most recently pushed - frame)
               ( fp points to a frame ptr, which pts to a frame ptr...)

( link creates a new frame. It fetches the cfa of the following word and
| pushes it onto the return stack. This is the cleanup routine. Then it
| links this frame into the list rooted at fp, and then returns to its
| caller, skipping the following cfa. link is called by a word that builds
| a new stack frame.)

: link     r> dup @  >r         ( fetch following cfa & push to r)
           fp @ >r  rp@ fp !    ( link this frame to previous)
           cell+ >r             ( skip fetched cfa) ;

( unlink undoes what link did. It unlinks the frame from the list rooted at
| fp, and then runs the cleanup routine, which will do whatever is
| necessary to de-allocate the frame and undo any state changes made by the
| word that called link.)

: unlink   r>  ( save return address)
           fp @ rp!  r> fp !    ( unlink frame)
           r> execute           ( execute cleanup word)
           >r  ( restore return address) ;

( unwind is useful in the context of exceptions. It starts at fp and
| unlinks each frame in turn until fp points to a frame with a zero link.)

: unwind   r>  ( save return address)
           -- begin  fp @ @  while  unlink  repeat
           begin  fp @  while  unlink  repeat
           >r  ( restore return address) ;


create remove  -]  unlink ;   ( remove pushes IP when executed!)


( Now some interesting applications.)

-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Dynamic binding
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
( Restore saved value of a variable.)
: restore
   r> ( ra)   r> r>  ( value addr) !   >r ( ra) ;

( Preserve the value of a variable for the duration of the execution of the
| calling word.)

: preserve  ( addr)  ( address of variable)
   r> ( ra)
   over ( addr) >r  swap @  ( value)  >r
   link restore ( push cleanup)
   remove >r    ( normal return - unlink and cleanup)
   >r ( ra) ;


-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Local variable frames
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
( Deallocate local variables.)
: unroom
   r> ( ra)
   r> ( #cells)  rp+!  ( rp+! takes cell count!)
   >r ( ra) ;

( Allocate space for local variables.)
( NOTE: do -not- try to use a for loop to push cells! It doesn't work! The
| return stack is being used to store the loop index, but you're busy
| pushing stuff there! All hell breaks loose! If you absolutely want to
| zero locals as they are allocated, do a begin/until loop with the count
| on the data stack.)

: room  ( #cells)
   r> ( ra)

   ( choose one! mark, zero, allocate)
   -- swap dup  begin  "55aa55aa >r  1-  dup 0= until  drop  ( mark)
   -- swap dup  begin          0 >r  1-  dup 0= until  drop  ( zero)
   swap dup  negate rp+!  ( allocate)

   ( #cells)  >r
   link unroom
   remove >r  ( normal return - unlink and cleanup)
   >r ( ra) ;

-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Trap handlers
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

( Here is a picture of the return stack, with high memory towards the top of
| the page, and low memory further down:
|
| ^   |                    |
| |   +--------------------+
| |   |  prev return addr  |    ... trap <trap-type> <handler>  ...
| |   +--------------------+         |
| |   | ip of call to trap |---------+
| |   +--------------------+
| |   |     saved sp       |
| |   +--------------------+
| |   |  trap type <pfa>   |
| |   +--------------------+
| |   |    cfa of nope     |   cleanup operation is to do nothing
| |   +--------------------+
| +---+     prev frame     |<--- fp
|     +--------------------+
|     |    ip of untrap    |<--- rp
|     +--------------------+                                          )

( pop trap type, sp, and ip)
( Like remove, untrap pushes its IP when executed.)
create untrap  -]  unlink  shunt shunt shunt ;

( trap: creates a new trap type, uniquely defined because the value it
| compiles is its own dictionary address. At runtime it "raises" this trap
| type, and unwinds the stack to find a matching handler, printing an error
| message if nothing matched. If it finds a handler, it calls it, but
| leaves the IP on the return stack that points to the code that -set- the
| trap, so the whole thing is re-executed until it exits successfully - ie,
| returns normally without trapping.)

: trap:  create  does>
         begin  fp @  0= if error" trapped" then
                unlink  dup r> =  until  ( matches trap type)
         drop  r> sp!  r@ cell+ cell+  ( skip to handler)  @execute ;

( trap is followed in the definition by a trap type word, and a handler.)
: trap   r> ( ra)
         dup cell- >r  ( resume address: call ourselves again!)
         sp@ cell+ >r  ( sp at time trap set; cell+ to ignore ra)
         dup @ >body >r  ( fetch and push trap type)
         link nope       ( null cleanup action; untrap cleans up)
         untrap >r       ( does the unlink and cleanup on normal return)
         ( ra)  cell+ cell+ >r  ( skip trap type and handler and return)
         ;
