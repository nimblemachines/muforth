( This is wrong, on purpose. I was trying to figure out why in one version
| of this word I was adding two and in another, one. It turns out that that
| first version -had- zero termination characters, so I was skipping the
| count byte and the termination. Try running this code as is; then change
| the below word to "dup 1+" and see how much better it works!)
