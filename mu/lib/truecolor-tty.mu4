loading Truecolor (24-bit color) support for terminals

( Many terminal emulator programs now support setting both the foreground
  and background text color using 24-bit color *literals*, rather than
  specifying an *index* into a table of 8, 16, or 256 colors. This is a
  *huge* improvement. The biggest problem with the lookup tables is that
  there generally is no way to *set* the color values from within a
  program - a text editor, say. If you wanted to explore using a particular
  color scheme - Solarized, for example - it meant coordinating between the
  editor and the terminal emulater to get the color table set up properly.
  It doesn't sound that hard, but it still caused endless headaches.

  As a personal example, I only got Solarized working with Vim once I
  realized that I could add truecolor support to Vim instead of relying on
  the "underlying" color table administered by the terminal emulator.

  And, amazingly, this works on "hterm" - the terminal program for
  Chromebooks.

  This is yet another example of legacy crap from the 1980s making it hard
  to do something that should be trivially simple: display text in a
  particular color.

  Unfortunately, even at this late date - it is 2018 as I write this -
  there is no standard way to set these 24-bit colors, or to query if a
  particular terminal or emulator can handle them.

  There is a lot more information about this here:

     https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728

  Assuming your terminal [emulator] can handle it, let's try it out!

  The foreground escape sequence is ESC[38;2;<r>;<g>;<b>m
  The background escape sequence is ESC[48;2;<r>;<g>;<b>m
  <r> <g> <b> range from 0 to 255 inclusive.
  The escape sequence ESC[0m returns output to default.

( Use "pictured numerics" to create the string at pad.)

: "m   char m hold ;
: ";   char ; hold ;
: ;#   ( component)  #s drop  "; ;
: (rgb)  ( rgb which)  radix preserve decimal  push  >rgb
   <#  "m  ;# ;# ;#  2 ;#  pop #s  " [" "hold  #> ;

: (fg)  ( rgb - a u)  38 (rgb) ;
: (bg)  ( rgb - a u)  48 (rgb) ;

: fg  (fg) type ;
: bg  (bg) type ;

: fg0  ( reset to normal)  ." [0m" ;

( 255,100,0 => hex ff6400)
: test  "ff6400 fg  ." TRUECOLOR"  fg0 ;

( For fun, let's "prettyprint" - with color - a C routine from muforth's
  implementation. This is from muforth/src/interpret.c.)
